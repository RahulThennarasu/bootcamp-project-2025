               <h2 class="post-title"> Snowflake Conference @ San Francisco</h2>
               <p class="post-excerpt">I had an awesome time at the Snowflake Summit 2025 in San Francisco. The energy was unreal and it was inspiring to be surrounded by so many people building the future of data. I loved seeing how Snowflake is growing into a full platform for intelligent applications, and it was cool to watch dbt Labs get recognized for their impact. The best part for me was meeting Thierry Cruanes and Benoit Dageville, along with a bunch of other folks who were open about their journeys and challenges. I left the week feeling motivated and excited to bring what I learned back into my own work.</p>

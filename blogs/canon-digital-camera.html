                    Found this camera from some storage room in my house recently. It's from 2007 and honestly, I've been 
                    using it more than my phone for taking photos. There's something nice about not having to think 
                    too much and its just point and shoot.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The photos have that early digital look that I love and the pictures come out looking really aesthetic. Been taking it around to capture people, myself, mountains, beaches, the city. 
                    It's refreshing to use something simple again.
